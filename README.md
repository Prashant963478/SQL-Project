# 📚 Online Bookstore Management – SQL Project

This project simulates a small **Online Bookstore database** using SQL.  
It uses three datasets – **Books, Customers, and Orders** – and answers both **basic** and **advanced queries** that reflect real-world business use cases such as sales tracking, revenue calculation, and customer insights.

## 📂 Datasets Used
- **Books.csv** – Details of books (Book_ID, Title, Author, Genre, Price, Stock, Published Year, etc.)
- **Customers.csv** – Customer details (Customer_ID, Name, City, Country, etc.)
- **Orders.csv** – Order details (Order_ID, Customer_ID, Book_ID, Quantity, Order_Date, Total_Amount, etc.)
